## Control script for pollen deposition model
###

# The model is a R based pollen dispersion model.
# The model allows for calibration of model parameters 
# given known contempary data and subsequent application 
# of these parameters for paleo-ecological studies 
# to assess the senstivity of lakes to change in ecosystem composition.

# Novel in this application is the propogation of parameter uncertainties
# and iteration of the hypothetical land surfaces. Therefore, robust 
# probability based estimates can be made (i.e. using Monte Carlo approaches).

## Technical options
use_parallel=FALSE # 
nos_cores=2 # 
deposition_model=3 # 1 = d**-1, 2 = d**-2, 3 = Sugita Prentice
nos_iter=16

## Domain extent
domain_extent_x=300 # extant of domain (pixels)
domain_extent_y=300 # extant of domain (pixels)
resolution=100 # resolution / pixel size (m)

## Species composition 
random_or_read="read" # are we making up or reading in a landscape
input_type="netcdf" # currently netcdf or tiff
input_filename="/home/lsmallma/Desktop/laguna_coitaramaforest_map_100m_resolution_with_lat_long.nc" # only used for read map
ecotone=FALSE # solid blocks of ecosystem rather than patch work (assumes 50:50 ratio as stating point before clearance)
weighted_patch=FALSE  # assume some weighting towards or aware from the lake
map_fixed=TRUE # i.e. does it change between iterations
show_map=FALSE  # generate plots of the first and last maps used in iteration
nos_species=2  # number of taxa considered
sp_fractions=c(80,20) #  percentage of each taxa overall, must equal 100 %
patch_size=1600 # forest clearance patches (radius, m)

## Lake location and size
lake_size=1600 # radius of lake (m)
lake_centred = FALSE # lake fixed to centre of domain or placed randomly
lake_fixed = TRUE # will lake be in the same location at all times
lake_specified = FALSE #  will the user give x,y pixel coordinates for lake centre
lake_user_x = 250 # rep(250,times=7) # pixel coordinates for the lake centre
lake_user_y = 250 # c(250,225,200,175,150,125,100) # y becomes less to move away from forest luke # pixel coordinates for the lake centre

## Parameters for Presentice (Sutton 1953; Prentice 1988) deposition model (option 3)
wind_sp=3    # wind speed (m.s-1)
fall_speed=c(0.018,0.0350)   # fall speed (m.s-1) of pollen; 0 = internal calculation
pollen_radius=10e-6          # radius of pollen grain (m)
pollen_productivity=c(1,1.5) # runif(1,0,15)

## physical constants which you are unlikely to want to change
gamma=0.125  # turbulence parameter = 2*gamma
diffusion_coefficient=0.12 # 0.3 # Vertical diffusion coefficient (m^1/8)
gravity=9.81 # gravity (m s-2)
rho0=2e6     # particle density (g m-3)
rho=1.27e6   # air density density (g m-3)
mu=1.8e-2    # dynamic viscosity (g m-1 s-1)
